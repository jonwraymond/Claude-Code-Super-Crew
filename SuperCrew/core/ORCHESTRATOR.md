# ORCHESTRATOR.md - Claude Code Super Crew Intelligent Routing System

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
Intelligent routing system for Claude Code Super Crew framework that provides comprehensive orchestration capabilities for analyzing codebases, creating specialists, and optimizing workflows.

## ðŸ§  Detection Engine

### Pre-Operation Validation Checks
**Resource Validation**:
- Token usage prediction based on operation complexity and scope
- Memory and processing requirements estimation
- File system permissions and available space verification
- MCP server availability and response time checks

**Compatibility Validation**:
- Flag combination conflict detection
- Persona + command compatibility verification
- Tool availability for requested operations
- Project structure requirements validation

**Risk Assessment**:
- Operation complexity scoring (0.0-1.0 scale)
- Failure probability based on historical patterns
- Resource exhaustion likelihood prediction
- Cascading failure potential analysis

### Pattern Recognition Rules

#### Complexity Detection
```yaml
simple:
  indicators:
    - single file operations
    - basic CRUD tasks
    - straightforward queries
    - < 3 step workflows
  token_budget: 5K
  time_estimate: < 5 min

moderate:
  indicators:
    - multi-file operations
    - analysis tasks
    - refactoring requests
    - 3-10 step workflows
  token_budget: 15K
  time_estimate: 5-30 min

complex:
  indicators:
    - system-wide changes
    - architectural decisions
    - performance optimization
    - > 10 step workflows
  token_budget: 30K+
  time_estimate: > 30 min
```

#### Domain Identification
```yaml
frontend:
  keywords: [UI, component, React, Vue, CSS, responsive, accessibility]
  file_patterns: ["*.jsx", "*.tsx", "*.vue", "*.css", "*.scss"]
  typical_operations: [create, implement, style, optimize, test]

backend:
  keywords: [API, database, server, endpoint, authentication, performance]
  file_patterns: ["*.js", "*.ts", "*.py", "*.go", "controllers/*", "models/*"]
  typical_operations: [implement, optimize, secure, scale]

infrastructure:
  keywords: [deploy, Docker, CI/CD, monitoring, scaling, configuration]
  file_patterns: ["Dockerfile", "*.yml", "*.yaml", ".github/*", "terraform/*"]
  typical_operations: [setup, configure, automate, monitor]

security:
  keywords: [vulnerability, authentication, encryption, audit, compliance]
  file_patterns: ["*auth*", "*security*", "*.pem", "*.key"]
  typical_operations: [scan, harden, audit, fix]

documentation:
  keywords: [document, README, wiki, guide, manual, instructions]
  file_patterns: ["*.md", "*.rst", "*.txt", "docs/*", "README*", "CHANGELOG*"]
  typical_operations: [write, document, explain, translate, localize]
```

## ðŸš¦ Routing Intelligence

### Wave Orchestration Engine
Multi-stage command execution with compound intelligence. Automatic complexity assessment or explicit flag control.

**Wave Control Matrix**:
```yaml
wave-activation:
  automatic: "complexity >= 0.7"
  explicit: "--wave-mode, --force-waves"
  override: "--single-wave, --wave-dry-run"

wave-strategies:
  progressive: "Incremental enhancement"
  systematic: "Methodical analysis"
  adaptive: "Dynamic configuration"
```

### Master Routing Table

| Pattern | Complexity | Domain | Auto-Activates | Confidence |
|---------|------------|---------|----------------|------------|
| "analyze architecture" | complex | infrastructure | architect persona, --ultrathink, Sequential | 95% |
| "create component" | simple | frontend | frontend persona, Magic, --uc | 90% |
| "implement feature" | moderate | any | domain-specific persona, Context7, Sequential | 88% |
| "implement API" | moderate | backend | backend persona, --seq, Context7 | 92% |
| "implement UI component" | simple | frontend | frontend persona, Magic, --c7 | 94% |
| "implement authentication" | complex | security | security persona, backend persona, --validate | 90% |
| "fix bug" | moderate | any | analyzer persona, --think, Sequential | 85% |
| "optimize performance" | complex | backend | performance persona, --think-hard, Playwright | 90% |
| "security audit" | complex | security | security persona, --ultrathink, Sequential | 95% |
| "write documentation" | moderate | documentation | scribe persona, --persona-scribe=en, Context7 | 95% |
