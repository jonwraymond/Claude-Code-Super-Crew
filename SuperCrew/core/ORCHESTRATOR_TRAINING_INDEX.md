- [ ] Local orchestrator-specialist optimization and enhancement
- [ ] Collaborative coordination with local orchestrator
- [ ] System validation and quality assurance

### For Local Orchestrator Specialist

#### Required Reading (In Order):
1. **ORCHESTRATOR_LOAD_TRAINING.md** - Understand collaboration and support role
2. **LOAD_COMMAND_REFERENCE.md** - Access execution checklists and protocols
3. **AGENT_SELECTION_PROMPT.md** - Understand global orchestrator's decision authority

#### Key Competencies to Master:
- [ ] Project-specific pattern analysis and insight provision
- [ ] Specialist integration validation and testing
- [ ] Effective collaboration with global orchestrator
- [ ] Enhancement reception and workflow optimization
- [ ] Local validation and ongoing orchestration

## Training Validation Checklist

### Global Orchestrator Readiness:
- [ ] Can analyze codebase and detect technologies systematically
- [ ] Understands specialist template customization process
- [ ] Can optimize local orchestrator-specialist effectively
- [ ] Knows how to collaborate with local orchestrator
- [ ] Can validate and document results comprehensively

### Local Orchestrator Specialist Readiness:
- [ ] Understands project-specific analysis responsibilities
- [ ] Can validate specialist integration effectively
- [ ] Knows how to receive and integrate enhancements
- [ ] Can collaborate productively with global orchestrator
- [ ] Can execute optimized workflows post-enhancement

## Quick Reference Summary

### `/crew:load` Execution Phases:
```yaml
PHASE_1_ANALYSIS:
  global: "Lead comprehensive codebase analysis"
  local: "Provide project-specific insights and patterns"
  
PHASE_2_GENERATION:
  global: "Generate and install project-appropriate specialists"
  local: "Validate specialist integration and accessibility"
  
PHASE_3_OPTIMIZATION:
  global: "Update local orchestrator-specialist with enhancements"
  local: "Receive and integrate routing and workflow optimizations"
  
PHASE_4_VALIDATION:
  both: "Test workflows, validate functionality, document results"
```

### Communication Protocol:
```yaml
COLLABORATION_FLOW:
  1. independent_analysis: "Both orchestrators analyze separately"
  2. collaborative_synthesis: "Share findings and plan together"
  3. coordinated_execution: "Execute with clear role delineation"
  4. joint_validation: "Test and validate results together"
  5. shared_documentation: "Document outcomes and guidance"
```

### Success Criteria:
```yaml
SUCCESS_INDICATORS:
  - All detected technologies have appropriate specialists
  - Orchestrator-specialist optimized for project workflows
  - Routing patterns efficient and effective
  - System validated and documented thoroughly
  - Both orchestrators can operate enhanced system effectively
```

## Emergency Protocols

### If Training Materials Are Inaccessible:
1. **Fallback to basic analysis**: Use standard codebase analysis patterns
2. **Conservative specialist generation**: Create only essential specialists
3. **Minimal orchestrator updates**: Apply basic routing optimizations
4. **Extended validation**: Perform thorough testing before completion

### If Collaboration Fails:
1. **Global orchestrator priority**: Global orchestrator proceeds independently
2. **Local validation critical**: Local orchestrator validates all changes
3. **Documentation essential**: Document any issues for post-execution review
4. **User notification**: Inform user of collaboration limitations

## Continuous Learning

### After Each `/crew:load` Execution:
- [ ] Review what worked well and what could be improved
- [ ] Document any new patterns or technologies encountered
- [ ] Update training materials with lessons learned
- [ ] Refine collaboration and communication protocols

### Periodic Training Updates:
- [ ] Review training materials quarterly
- [ ] Update competency checklists based on experience
- [ ] Enhance collaboration protocols based on feedback
- [ ] Expand reference materials with new scenarios

## Training Support

### Questions or Issues During Training:
1. **Reference the specific training document** for detailed guidance
2. **Use the quick reference** for immediate execution needs
3. **Document any gaps or confusion** for training improvement
4. **Escalate fundamental issues** to framework maintainers

### Feedback and Improvement:
- Training materials should be continuously improved based on usage
- Both orchestrators should provide feedback on effectiveness
- Real-world execution experiences should inform training updates
- Success stories and lessons learned should be shared

---

**Training Mandate**: Both orchestrators must complete the appropriate training path before participating in `/crew:load` execution. Effective orchestration depends on thorough understanding of roles, responsibilities, and collaboration protocols.
